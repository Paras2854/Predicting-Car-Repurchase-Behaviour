# 🚗 Car Buyer Repurchase Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Understanding car buyer loyalty is essential for automakers, especially when designing marketing strategies and customer retention programs. This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a customer will repurchase a car from the company.

By analyzing historical data such as customer demographics, car preferences, and purchase history, the model helps identify key factors influencing repurchase decisions.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Goal**: Develop a machine learning model to predict if an existing customer is likely to repurchase a car (Yes/No).
- **Outcome**: Classify customers as likely or unlikely to make another purchase.
- **Stakeholder Need**: Enable the marketing team to:
  - Target high-potential repurchasers with personalized campaigns.
  - Maximize return on investment from retention efforts.
  - Gain actionable insights into customer loyalty drivers.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
The following classification algorithms were implemented:
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Extra Trees Classifier  

📊 **Model Performance:**  
Among all models tested, the **Random Forest Classifier** delivered the best predictive performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Outcome
The model achieved strong predictive performance and highlighted key drivers of customer loyalty. It provides valuable support for strategic decision-making in customer engagement and marketing campaigns.
